      <h2>Colour Psychology in Marketing</h2>
      <p>Color is a powerful psychological tool in marketing, shaping consumer perceptions, emotions, and decision-making. Each hue carries distinct associations—red evokes urgency and excitement, making it ideal for promotions and fast food brands, while blue conveys trust and stability, frequently used by financial and technology companies. Green represents sustainability and health, resonating with eco-conscious audiences, whereas black signifies luxury and sophistication, often seen in high-end branding. By strategically leveraging color psychology, businesses can strengthen brand identity, enhance customer engagement, and influence purchasing behavior, ultimately driving market success.</p>

    <section><p>Color is one of the most influential elements in marketing, often determining a brand’s first impression and long-term recognition. Research suggests that up to 90% of snap judgments about products are based on color alone, making it a critical component of branding and advertising. Companies meticulously choose colors to convey their values and appeal to their target audience—fast-food giants like McDonald's and KFC use red and yellow to stimulate appetite and excitement, while luxury brands such as Chanel and Rolex rely on black and gold to symbolize exclusivity and elegance.</p>
        Beyond branding, color plays a pivotal role in influencing purchasing behavior. E-commerce platforms utilize contrasting colors to highlight “Buy Now” buttons, drawing customers’ attention and encouraging conversions. Supermarkets and retail stores strategically arrange product packaging to create visual appeal, while seasonal color trends dictate fashion and design industries. Even social media platforms leverage color to keep users engaged—Facebook’s blue fosters a sense of security and trust, while Instagram’s vibrant gradient sparks creativity and emotion.
        
        In an increasingly competitive market, mastering color psychology is no longer optional—it’s a necessity. Businesses that harness the right color strategies gain a psychological edge, ensuring that their brand stands out, resonates with consumers, and ultimately drives sales
