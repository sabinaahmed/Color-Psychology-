      <h2>How Color Works as Therapy ?</h2>
      <p>Color is more than just a visual experience; it has a profound impact on emotions, behaviors, and overall well-being. From ancient civilizations to modern psychology, color has been used as a therapeutic tool to heal, energize, and restore balance in individuals. This field of study, known as color therapy or chromotherapy, explores how different colors influence mental, emotional, and physical health</p>
      <h3>Understanding Color Therapy</h3>
      <p>Color therapy is based on the idea that different colors evoke specific physiological and psychological responses. This form of therapy uses light and color frequencies to stimulate energy points in the body, helping to restore balance and promote healing. While color therapy is often used in alternative medicine, scientific studies also support the influence of color on mood and behavior.Scientific research has shown that color can affect the brain’s neurological responses. Different wavelengths of light are processed by the brain, triggering hormonal and emotional changes. For instance:</p>
      <p>Blue light has been found to reduce stress and enhance focus by influencing the production of melatonin and serotonin.

        Red light therapy is used to promote circulation and energy levels.
        
        Green light is known for its calming effect, often used in meditation and relaxation spaces.</p>
