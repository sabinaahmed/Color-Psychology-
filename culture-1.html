      <h2>The Cultural Impact of Color: A Global Perspective</h2>
      <p>Color is deeply ingrained in human psychology, culture, and traditions. Different societies attach varying meanings to colors, influencing emotions, behaviors, and decisions. From religious symbolism to marketing strategies, the cultural impact of color is vast and significant.

A study by Joe Hallock on "Color Assignments" found that individuals from different regions have unique preferences and associations with colors. For example, blue was overwhelmingly preferred across cultures, but the meanings assigned to other colors varied based on geographical and cultural contexts.</p>
