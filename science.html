      <h1>The Science Behind Colors: How Light and Perception Shape Our World</h1>
      <p>Color is not just an artistic expression—it is a fascinating interplay of physics, biology, and psychology. At its core, color is the result of light interacting with objects and being interpreted by the human brain. When light strikes an object, certain wavelengths are absorbed while others are reflected, creating the colors we perceive. The human eye detects these wavelengths through specialized cells called cones, which allow us to differentiate millions of shades. However, color perception is not universal; factors such as lighting, environment, and even cultural background influence how we interpret colors.

       <p> Beyond vision, colors have measurable psychological and physiological effects. Studies show that exposure to blue light can boost alertness, while red hues can increase heart rate and evoke a sense of urgency. These scientific principles drive industries from marketing and design to healthcare and technology. Whether it’s the calming blue of a hospital room or the energizing red of a sale banner, the science behind colors plays a crucial role in shaping human experience and behavior.
        <p>The rainbow used to have just 5 colours – until 1704 when Sir Isaac Newton added orange and indigo to the list simply because he had a fondness for the supposedly mystical properties of the number 7.In short, how we interpret colours, even how we see them, is more a product of nurture than nature.

        <h2>Understanding the Science of Light and Color</h2>
        <p>At its core, color is a result of light. Light is made up of electromagnetic waves, and the portion visible to the human eye is known as the visible spectrum, which ranges from violet to red. Different colors appear because objects absorb certain wavelengths of light while reflecting others. For example, a leaf appears green because it absorbs all wavelengths of light except for green, which is reflected into our eyes.

          This process of color perception begins when light enters the eye and reaches the retina, where specialized photoreceptor cells called cones detect different wavelengths of light. Humans typically have three types of cones that are sensitive to short (blue), medium (green), and long (red) wavelengths. These cones work together to allow us to perceive millions of colors. In contrast, some animals, like dogs, have fewer types of cones and see a more limited range of colors, while others, such as mantis shrimp, have an advanced color perception far beyond human capability.</p>

       <h2>How Perception of Color Varies</h2>
       <p>Color perception is not universal; it is influenced by several factors, including lighting conditions, surrounding colors, and even cultural background. The same color can appear different depending on the environment, a phenomenon known as color constancy. This explains why a white dress might look bluish in certain lighting but appear purely white in another.

        Moreover, the psychological and cultural interpretations of color vary across different societies. For instance, while white symbolizes purity and peace in Western cultures, it is associated with mourning in many Eastern traditions. Similarly, red is considered a color of love and passion in some cultures, while in others, it represents danger or warning. These variations highlight the complex relationship between the science of color and human experience.</p>
        <h2>The Future of Color Science</h2>
        <p>As research in neuroscience and artificial intelligence progresses, scientists are uncovering new ways in which color affects human behavior and decision-making. Emerging fields such as neuromarketing analyze how color impacts purchasing habits, while advancements in biotechnology explore how color perception might be altered or enhanced in the future.

          Furthermore, the development of color-changing materials, such as temperature-sensitive fabrics and responsive paints, opens new possibilities in fashion, architecture, and technology. These innovations highlight how our understanding of color continues to evolve, shaping industries and experiences in ways we are only beginning to explore.</p>
